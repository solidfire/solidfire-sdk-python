        cluster before the drive is removed from the cluster. This is an
        asynchronous method.
        Depending on the total capacity of the drives being removed, it may
        take several minutes to migrate all of the data.
        Use the *\"get_async_result\"* method to check the status of the remove
        operation.




        When removing multiple drives, use a single *\"remove_drives\"* method
        call rather than multiple individual methods with a single drive each.
        This reduces the amount of data balancing that must occur to even
        stabilize the storage load on the cluster.




        You can also remove drives with a \"failed\" status using
        \"RemoveDrives\".
        When you remove a drive with a \"failed\" status it is not returned to
        an \"available\" or \"active\" status.
        The drive is unavailable for use in the cluster.




        Use the *\"list_drives\"* method to obtain the *drive_ids* for the
        drives you want to remove.

        *start_bulk_volume_read* allows you to initialize a bulk volume read
        session on a specified volume.
        Only two bulk volume processes can run simultaneously on a volume.
        When you initialize the session, data is read from a SolidFire storage
        volume for the purposes of storing the data on an external backup
        source.
        The external data is accessed by a web server running on a SolidFire
        node.
        Communications and server interaction information for external data
        access is passed by a script running on the SolidFire storage system.







        At the start of a bulk volume read operation, a snapshot of the volume
        is made and the snapshot is deleted when the read has completed.
        You can also read a snapshot of the volume by entering the ID of the
        snapshot as a parameter.
        Reading a previous snapshot does not create a new snapshot of the
        volume, nor does the previous snapshot be deleted when the read
        completes.







        **Note**: This process creates a new snapshot if the ID of an existing
        snapshot is not provided.
        Snapshots can be created if cluster fullness is at stage 2 or 3.
